TODO:
* fix: unauthentic commit history in git repos versus main svn repo which is used as a source to mirror; is used a single revision fetch from the SVN at a time before the rebase and the push into the GIT in all repos to make authentic commit history in snv-to-git repos (any taken working copy in the GIT is exact to the associated SVN revision) and in git-by-git repos (the same hashes for a single SVN revision in all git repos which are mirrored from the same svn repo)
* fix: generated commit e-mail address from the SVN revision in the GIT like `user@<repo-guid>` is replaced by a real user commit e-mail has declared in the config; now a git hub can generate correct commit statistic based on actual commit e-mail
#
# As a result of the fixes above all git repositories addressed in all scripts has to be recreated/regenerated from the scratch to apply the changes.
# CAUTION:
#   Because many git hubs has repo based project system instead of standalone
#   project system, then that might involve a loss of information attached to a
#   git repository like favorites/forks and other information after erasing a
#   git repository!

* changed: inner xonsh piping functionality is not used because is not stable yet (see the `README_EN.known_issues.txt` for the details)
