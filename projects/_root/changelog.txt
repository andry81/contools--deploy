2019.09.07:
* new: [initiated] scripts conversion into the python scripts based on the plumbum module language
* changed: [important] aboarted scripts conversion into the python scripts based on the xonsh module language as not stable, not reliable and not complete:
** Gosh, too many issues not addressed to anyone! Authors has chosen to use it as a terminal language in the first place and does not consider to use it as a shell replacement. So many issues in the scripting area is still not resolved and authors are not interested to resolve them.
** Here is the list of the issues which I've got discovered just in the moment to begin a conversion (https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/created_by/andry81 ):
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3302 : "hangs around `source` operator"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3301 : "`source` xsh file with try/except does hang"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3299 : "hangs after `source` of a script which has been already sourced"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3236 : "pipe from python function to an external executable does hang (Windows)"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3202 : "`print` order broken while piping"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3198 : "can not use log from xonsh on any arbitrary xonsh code"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3197 : "raw strings still expands"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3192 : "multiline python evaluation `@(...)` breaks the parser"
*** https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3190 : "module `cmdix` executables is not visible from the python `Scripts` directory"
*** ... and others which I still consider as hindering issues to move to the xonsh language in the first place!

2019.09.01:

* new: `README_EN.known_issues.txt` file for known issues around the scripts

* changed: inner xonsh piping functionality is not used because is not stable yet (see the `README_EN.known_issues.txt` for the details)
